<!-- 
Use this file to manually add your own notational scales to AlphaLive.

The array of numbers you add below are applied to a set of pads or sequencer rows in numerical order.
The scales here should always start with 0 which will be the root note.
The following numbers are the intervals from the root note.
The root note is selected via the piano interface in AlphaLive.

Use the following format: 

    <SCALE name="insert scales name here" layout="insert 48 integer numbers here seperated by single whitespaces (including after the last number)"/>
    
See the Raga Madhuri scale below for an example of this.
Failure to comply to this exact format will result in your scales not appearing in the Toolbox in AlphaLive, or the scale will not be mapped out as expected.
