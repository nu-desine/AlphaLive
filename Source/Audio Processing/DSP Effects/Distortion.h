/*
 This seems like a good article on DSP distortion http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/music-dsp/FAQs/guitar_distortion_FAQ.html .
 It states that the processing chain of a good 'overdrive' distortion effect should be in the following format:
 
 Pre-EQ (BPF) -> Pre-gain -> Nonlinear waveshaping function -> Post-EQ (LPF) -> Post-gain
 
 In the simplest form the user could be allowed to control both filters centre/cutoff frequencies ('Tone 1' and 'Tone 2'), pre-gain 
 ('Overdrive?') and post-gain (Gain), though post-gain probably won't need to be an AlphaTouch parameter.
 
 In a more advanced distortion effect, the user could have access certain parameters of the waveshaping function in order
 to have more control over the exact distortion sound. Also they could have control over the bandwidths of the filters.
 
 In an even more advanced distortion effect, multiple BPF could be used as part of the pre-EQ with all centre frequencies
 and bandwidths being controllable.
 
 
 Things to consider
    - also seen a LPF as the pre-EQ, would this be better or needed as well?
    - what BPF from the dspfiltercpp library should I used? BandPass1 or BandPass2?
