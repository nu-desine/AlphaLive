// This file contains 5 structs.

// The top three are mode specific structs.

// The 4th struct (padSettings) is for all the settings of a single 
// pad which includes the first 3 mode structs.

// The final struct (settings) is the main struct which includes
// 48 instances for the padSettings struct as well as global settings.

//IS THIS FILE STILL NEEDED FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS?
//If so, this file probably needs updating with new parameters (such as velocity range)
