//Current issues with this class:

//Setting the number of decimal places when setting the label text from a float/double (mainly in setValue()).
//ideally you'll want to get the step size of the slider (getInterval()) and work out how many decimal place to display from that.
//I've added a quick fix to setValue() but it's not the best way of handling it.
