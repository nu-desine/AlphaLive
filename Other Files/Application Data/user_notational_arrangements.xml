<!-- 
Use this file to manually add your own notational arrangements to AlphaLive.

The array of numbers you add below are applied to the set of pads in numerical order.
The layouts here should always start with 0 which will be the root note on pad one.
The following numbers are the intervals from the root note.
The root note is selected via the piano interface in AlphaLive.

Use the following format: 

    <LAYOUT name="insert layout name here" layout="insert 48 integer numbers here seperated by single whitespaces (including after the last number)"/>
    
See the Blues layout below for an example of this.
Failure to comply to this exact format will result in your layouts not appearing in the Toolbox in AlphaLive, or the layout will not be mapped out as expected.
