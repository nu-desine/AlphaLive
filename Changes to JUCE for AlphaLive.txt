
There are a few changes that have been made to the JUCE library code
for AlphaLive to work correctly. Make sure that if you update the library
code you reapply these changes:

JuceLibraryCode/modules/juce_audio_devices/juce_audio_devices.cpp
Line "#include <iasiodrv.h>"
Change to: 
#include <../Source/Third Party Libraries/ASIOSDK/common/iasiodrv.h>

JuceLibraryCode/modules/juce_audio_devices/sources/juce_AudioTransportSource.cpp
Line 289-290
Change to:
info.buffer->applyGain (i, info.startSample, info.numSamples,
                        gain);
